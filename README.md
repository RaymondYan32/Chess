# Chess
This program is currently incomplete! Bug testing for this version has not been completed as well.

A recreation of chess in for 2 players.
Currently everything should be functioning except for the ability for: 
- pawn advancement
- castle
- and en passe 

Other functions such as proper turn based movement of a pieces, removal of pieces, and check/checkmate should be working properly


To use:

1. Download and unzip to location of your choosing
2. Open folder and run "chess.jar"
3. Enjoy with a friend

P.S. As currently this program does not use any external images files, chess.jar should be able to run by itself without being with the source code folder
